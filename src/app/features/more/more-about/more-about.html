            <p>
                Hi! I'm Erikson Orozco, a college student and backend enthusiast. While I specialize in backend
                development, I also dabble in frontend development to create comprehensive academic projects. My playing
                field includes REST APIs, web development, and microservices. I'm a fan of Go (Golang) and Java, but I'm
                always exploring new technologies. When I'm not coding, you'll find me debugging my decisions or making
                coffee.

            <p>
                I am currently in my sixth semester of studying Systems Engineering and Computer Science at the
                University of San Carlos of Guatemala. In addition to my academic studies, I have earned certifications
                in:

                <li><strong>Microservices</strong> & <strong>Docker</strong> – Código Facilito</li>
                <li><strong>GitHub Education</strong> & <strong>MySQL</strong> – Udemy</li>

            <h1>Roles</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a two-faceted person: a backend developer by passion and a frontend explorer by necessity. In
                academic projects, I've built everything from scalable compilers and APIs to interactive web
                applications. Whether optimizing databases or tweaking UI components, I love turning my ideas into
                working code.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> I break down complex technical jargon into clear, human-friendly
                    language.</li>
                <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> I collaborate with empathy and humility — success is a shared victory.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> I approach problems like a debugger chasing down a segfault —
                    precise and persistent.</li>
